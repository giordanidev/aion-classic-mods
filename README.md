BATCH file made by LoadRNG. TESTED ON WINTOWS 10 20H2 for Aion Classic NA.

INSTALL:
1. Run "Aion Classic Mods.bat" as ADMIN;
2. If no error messages, on the first time it will copy the fonts and filter files to the correct directory, and rename the "voice" folder to "voiceNA";
-- Renaming the folder inside L10N\Sounds will make the client load the original KR combat voices (cutscene voices are not affected), which are a LOT less screamy.
3. You should receive a message informing that the JP fonts have been activated;
4. Done.

CHANGE BACK TO NA ORIGINALS (recomended to do it everytime a new update is up, or else it will redownload the "voice" folder):
1. Run "Aion Classic Mods.bat" as ADMIN (yes, same file);
2. You should receive a message informing that the NA fonts have been activated (this process will NOT delete the Japanese fonts but it will rename the JP fonts file as "hit_number.pak.JP") and "voiceNA" folder renamed to "voice". This proccess will not uninstall the chat filter;
3. Done.

UNINSTALL:
1. Run "Uninstall Aion Classic Mods.bat" as ADMIN;
2. If no error messages all Japanese fonts will be removed and fonts will be restored to NA, chat filter will be erased and voice folder will be restored to match original NA combat voices;
3. Done.
